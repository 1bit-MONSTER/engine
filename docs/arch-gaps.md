# Architecture gaps: significant arrivals the registry does not map

The registry ([registry.md](registry.md)) maps an HF architecture only when a pinned backend's own code accepts it. It is generated from the pinned sources; nothing in it is typed in by hand. So "support" cannot be faked with an alias, and the census counts every other architecture as unmapped.

**Alias or real work?** Some unmapped arrivals are renamed or same-shape siblings of a supported family, and are fixed where the backend is (upstream, or our fork) by mapping the name. Others only look like a supported family. For those, mapping the name would advertise support that cannot be served, or silently compute something else.

This page is the reviewed evidence for the second kind: what each family is, what it adds over the closest supported architecture, and what real support requires. It exists so that:
- nobody later "fixes" one of them with an alias;
- whoever implements one starts from these measurements.

`registry/significant.json` lists the reviewed classes. `tools/registry_build.py --check-gaps` (ctest `registry_gaps`) fails if one of them becomes mapped without a recorded reason, and the build prints the same warning. A pin bump that brings real upstream support then gets a person's look before the class counts as supported.

**Provenance.** The review was written for 1bit-MONSTER's own engine, before this repository (the 1bit-MONSTER census, 2026-09-12/13), and is kept as written below. The `RCPP_ARCH_*` names, `rcpp_arch_from_string`, `registry/arch.h`, `src/*.cpp` and `census/*` it cites are that engine's, not this one's. Where it says "the engine", read the old engine: `englishbase`, for example, was implemented there, not here. The configs, checkpoints and reasons are the models' own, so the conclusions hold here too: none of these is an alias of a family this engine's backends run.

## `deepseekv41` — DeepSeek V4.1

* **Class / model_type**: `DeepseekV41ForCausalLM` / `deepseek_v41` (text tower
  `deepseek_v41_text`); example `deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash`,
  `Solstice-AI/DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash-UNCENSORED-FP8`.
* **Shape**: **40 layers, H=5120, 64 heads, 1 kv head, 384 experts, vocab
  129280** — versus V4 Flash's 43 layers / H=4096 / 256 experts. It is a
  different model, not a revision label.
* **Keys V4 does not have**: `engram_*` (8: `engram_layer_ids`,
  `engram_num_embeddings`, `engram_vocab_size`, `engram_compressed_vocab_size`,
  `engram_max_ngram_size`, `engram_n_heads`, `engram_head_dim`,
  `engram_pad_token_id`), `candidate_block_size`, `candidate_source_layer_id`,
  `candidate_topk_blocks`, `index_source_layer_ids`, `kv_source_layer_ids`.
  (`dspark_*` is *not* V4.1-exclusive — `DeepSeek-V4-Flash-DSpark` carries it
  under `model_type: deepseek_v4`.) It is also a multimodal wrapper
  (`vision_config: deepseek_v41_vision`, `image_token_id`).
* **Why an alias is wrong**: `src/deepseek_v4.cpp` reads only
  hidden/layer/head/expert/`hc_*` scalars, so a V4.1 checkpoint would load
  through the V4 path and produce tokens while **silently ignoring the engram
  and candidate-block machinery** — the silent-substitution failure this repo
  bans, not a crash.
* **Real support needs**: shape-agnostic config + the engram embedding path +
  candidate-block sparse attention (and a scope decision for the vision tower),
  validated against reference logits from the HF implementation.

## `qwen3mamba3` — Qwen3 + Mamba-3 hybrid

* **Class / model_type**: `Qwen3Mamba3ForCausalLM` / `qwen3_mamba3`; example
  `arianraje/qwen3-4b-mamba3-hybrid-stage2b-kd-bias1`.
* **Keys**: `layer_types` (attention/SSM mix) plus Mamba-**3** knobs —
  `mamba_mimo_rank`, `mamba_bc_norm_eps`, `mamba_bc_bias_init`,
  `mamba_rope_fraction`, `mamba_a_floor`, `mamba_chunk_size`, `mamba_d_head`,
  `mamba_d_state`, `mamba_expand`, `mamba_n_groups`, `mamba_n_heads`.
* **Why an alias is wrong**: the engine has Mamba-1 (`RCPP_ARCH_MAMBA`) and
  Mamba-2 hybrids (`FALCONH1`, `NEMOTRONH`, `GRANITEMOEHYBRID`). MIMO rank, BC
  normalisation, an `a_floor`, and a rope fraction inside the SSM are Mamba-3
  parameters with no Mamba-2 equivalent — mapping to a Mamba-2 path would
  compute a different recurrence.
* **Real support needs**: a Mamba-3 SSM kernel + the hybrid layer loop, gated
  on decode validation against the reference.

## `molmoact2` — MolmoAct2 (vision-language-action)

* **Class / model_type**: `MolmoAct2ForConditionalGeneration` / `molmoact2`;
  example `NUSMAGIC/MolmoAct2-MolmoAct2-SO100_101`.
* **Text tower**: `text_config: molmoact2_text` — 36 layers, H=2560, 32 heads,
  8 kv, vocab 154624 (`qk_norm_type`, `rope_scaling_layers`, `norm_after`).
* **Not a text-only decoder**: `action_expert_config`, `flow_matching_*` (6
  keys), `max_action_dim`, `max_action_horizon`, action/state/depth token
  ranges — the model's contract is action generation, with depth reasoning.
* **Why an alias is wrong**: the existing `molmo` → `RCPP_ARCH_OLMO` mapping is
  right for a Molmo *VLM*; here it would drop the entire action expert.
* **Real support needs**: a scope decision first (text tower only, or the action
  path), then the action-expert/flow-matching head if in scope.

## `cosmos3edge` — Cosmos3-Edge (video world model)

* **Class / model_type**: `Cosmos3EdgeForConditionalGeneration` /
  `cosmos3_edge`; example `ubr-physical-ai/Cosmos3-Edge-NF4-bnb`.
* **Text tower**: `cosmos3_edge_text` — 28 layers, H=2048, 16 heads, 8 kv,
  vocab 131072, `mlp_bias`, `pretraining_tp` (llama-shaped). Alongside
  `vision_config` (`cosmos3_edge_vision`, `num_channels` → video patch embed),
  `projector_config`, `video_token_id`.
* **Why an alias is wrong**: the text tower *looks* llama-shaped, but the model
  is a video world model; the engine has no video/image pipeline for it, so a
  mapping would advertise support for something that cannot be served.
* **Real support needs**: scope decision (is video in scope at all?) before any
  mapping.

## `qwendriveforplanning` — Qwen-Drive (driving planner)

* **Class / model_type**: `QwenDriveForPlanning` / `qwen_drive`; example
  `Yuro1991/Qwen-Drive-1.0-4B`.
* **Not a text decoder**: the top-level config nests a `vlm_config`
  (`Qwen3_5ForConditionalGeneration` — the Qwen3.5 text tower plus vision) and an
  `expert_config`, and its own keys are trajectory planning: `trajectory_hz`,
  `trajectory_point_dim`, `num_future_points`, `num_history_points`,
  `trajectory_scale`, `num_inference_steps`, `noise_init_std`, `min_one_minus_t`,
  `max_reasoning_tokens`, plus `id2label`/`label2id` for two labels. Image
  geometry (`image_patch_size`, `image_spatial_merge_size`,
  `image_temporal_patch_size`, `current_image_pixels`, `history_image_pixels`)
  confirms a video/image input path.
* **Why an alias is wrong**: the familiar part is the Qwen3.5 tower; the model's
  contract is a **driving trajectory** — a sampled (denoising) plan over
  `num_inference_steps` with a noise seed and `min_one_minus_t`, not tokens. The
  engine has no head or pipeline for that, so a mapping would serve the tower and
  silently drop the planner, exactly as with `molmoact2` and `cosmos3edge` above.
* **Real support needs**: a scope decision first (is trajectory planning in scope
  at all?), then the expert/trajectory head.

## Uncovered classes reviewed later — same standard, and still not aliases

The lane split above is the *watcher's*: a class is printed `!! SIGNIFICANT` when
`_is_significant()` calls it a major-family/vision arrival, and `!! UNCOVERED`
otherwise — and the alert's instruction for that second lane is "add the mapping
… alias if it is a known family". The three below arrived in the `!! UNCOVERED`
lane on 2026-09-13 and are **not** aliases either, for the same reason the
sections above exist: a mapping would claim support the engine has not
validated, and for `englishbase` it would be silently wrong rather than merely
unsupported.

Evidence below is from the official HF configs **and the models' own modeling
code**, fetched 2026-09-13.

### `englishbase` — `SlayerLab/fabryka-english-250m-e01-sft-v1`

**Implemented 2026-09-13 — no longer an uncovered class** (`RCPP_ARCH_ENGLISHBASE`
= 1006, generic backend): the two-matrix relu2 MLP rides the non-gated FFN branch
and the parameter-free QK-norm is the existing per-head path driven by an all-ones
`[head_dim]` weight. Validated token-for-token against the model's own code — 68/68
greedy tokens over three prompts — with `census/englishbase_parity_check.cpp`. The
review below is kept as the record of *why it was not an alias*, which is what
decided the shape of the implementation.

* **Class / model_type**: `EnglishBaseForCausalLM` / `fabryka_english_base`.
* **Shape**: 36 layers, H=768, 6 heads / 2 kv, head_dim 128, intermediate 3040,
  vocab 32768, tied embeddings, rope theta 10000, `rms_norm_eps` 1e-6,
  `qk_norm: true` — llama-shaped on the surface, which is why the watcher filed
  it as a family variant rather than a significant arrival.
* **Decisive evidence — the model's own `model.py`**: when
  `recipe.activation == "relu2"` (this config's `recipe` says exactly that) the
  block's MLP is replaced by `ReluSquaredMLP`, which computes
  `down_proj(relu(up_proj(x)).square())` — **one up matrix, no gate, ReLU²** —
  and the same file describes its QK normalization as *parameter-free*.
  `hidden_act: "silu"` is only the default the Llama config class fills in; the
  recipe overrides the MLP at construction, so the two keys disagree and the
  code is what settles it.
* **Why an alias is wrong**: Llama's and Qwen3's MLP is gated SwiGLU
  (`gate_proj` + `up_proj` + `down_proj`, SiLU), and Qwen3's qk-norm carries
  learned `q_norm`/`k_norm` weights. A mapping would load and then compute a
  different function — silent substitution, not a crash.
* **Real support needs**: a two-matrix ReLU² MLP and a parameter-free QK-norm, or
  a loud refusal.

### `gdn2` — `Berlm/hyb16-gdn2-s1`

* **Class / model_type**: `GDN2ForCausalLM` / `gdn2`.
* **Shape**: 24 layers, H=1024, 6 heads, head_dim 128, `conv_size` 4, hybrid —
  full attention on layers 3/7/11/15/19/23 — dense SwiGLU (2816), vocab 32000,
  tied embeddings.
* **The config schema is `fla`'s** (flash-linear-attention), not HF's:
  `attn_mode: chunk`, `fuse_cross_entropy` / `fuse_norm` / `fuse_swiglu`,
  `expand_v`, `use_short_conv`, `allow_neg_eigval`, and an `ra_*` block
  (`ra_project`, `ra_gate_b`, `ra_theta_init`, `ra_lambda_max`, `ra_feedback`)
  that no engine path reads.
* **Nearest implemented family, and why that is still not a mapping**: the
  registry does have Gated-Delta paths — `gateddeltanet` / `deltanet` /
  `tinygdn` → `RCPP_ARCH_QWEN3NEXT`, and `RCPP_ARCH_QWEN35` is Qwen3.5's *dense*
  GDN — but the engine's reader (`src/qwen3_5.cpp`) keys on Qwen3.5's own field
  names (`linear_conv_kernel_dim`, `linear_num_key_heads`,
  `linear_value_head_dim`) and on tensor names with expected sizes
  (`linear_attn.conv1d.weight`). This config supplies neither. A matching
  mechanism is not a matching checkpoint; an alias here would be a guess about
  weight layout.
* **Real support needs**: an `fla` → engine config adapter, a tensor-layout check
  against one real checkpoint, and a decision on `ra_*`.

### `haiku` — `kerzgrr/Haiku-base`

* **Class / model_type**: `HaikuForCausalLM` / `haiku`.
* **Shape**: 36 layers, H=1024, 8 heads / 8 kv, `layer_types` = `kda` ×3 then
  `gated_mla` (`full_attention_interval: 4`), `mlp_activation: "situ_glu"`
  (`situ_gate_cap`, `situ_up_cap`), MLA ranks (`mla_q_lora_rank` 512,
  `mla_kv_lora_rank` 256, `mla_qk_nope_head_dim` / `mla_v_head_dim` 128),
  `partial_rotary_factor` 0.5, rope 1e6, and MTP heads (`mtp_num_heads`,
  `mtp_adapter_rank`, `mtp_loss_weight`).
* **Why an alias is wrong**: KDA and gated MLA *are* named in the registry —
  `RCPP_ARCH_KIMI_K3` is "Moonshot Kimi K3 — 2.8T MoE with KDA + Gated MLA +
  LatentMoE" — but that token is **routed, not implemented**: `include/kimi_k3.h`
  is included by nothing in the tree and its `load_from_gguf` prints
  `[KimiK3] Loading not yet implemented for Strix Halo targets.` and returns
  false; `src/model_router.cpp` has no branch for the arch, so it falls through
  to the generic `hip_gpu` → `cpu_generic` default; and `situ_glu` appears in no
  engine source — the only SITU in the tree is upstream llama.cpp's
  `kimi_k3_situ`. (That routing/validation split is deliberate and documented:
  issue #1635, closed as "not fixable on this box".) Mapping Haiku onto KIMI_K3
  would chain one unvalidated class onto another.
* **Real support needs**: a SITU-GLU MLP plus a real KDA / gated-MLA
  implementation — the K3 work itself, which `research/TRACKING.md` still
  carries as not started ("QK-Normed MLA absorption on Kimi K3 gated-MLA
  decode").

### `vapor` — `Neeze/Vapor-2B-V1.2`

* **Class / model_type**: `VaporForCausalLM` / `vapor`.
* **It looks like the cleanest alias of the five.** The config carries the LFM2
  schema *verbatim*: every `block_*` and `conv_*` key identical to LFM2-2.6B,
  **all 30 `layer_types` identical**, hidden 2048, 30 layers, 32 heads / 8 kv,
  intermediate 10752, `conv_L_cache` 3. What is left over is packaging (`dtype`,
  `auto_map`, the `tie_*` pair), config-driven (vocab 128000, rope theta 1e7) —
  and one thing that is neither: an explicit `rank_config`.
* **The checkpoint is what disqualifies it** (weights index read 2026-09-13):
  layer 0 stores the dense SwiGLU form — `feed_forward.w1/w2/w3` — and
  **layers 1–28 do not**. They store `feed_forward.A2`, `A_shared`, `B1`, `B2`,
  `B3` plus `side_A2`, `side_A_shared`, `side_B1..B3`: the `rank_config`'s
  `SharedSwiGLULinear` (r_shared 1396, r2 1116, side_rank 8) realised in the
  tensors rather than a training-time detail that materialises on export.
* **Why an alias is wrong**: the dense names the readers know (`w1`/`w3`, ~18
  hits each in this repo) describe layer 0 only; `A_shared`, `side_B1` and
  `feed_forward.A2` have **0 hits** anywhere in the tree. An LFM2 mapping would
  read the two dense layers it recognises and have nothing for the 28 factorized
  ones.
* **Real support needs**: a materialisation (or runtime) path for
  `SharedSwiGLULinear`, alongside the plain dense block, then decode validation.

### `fidel` — `4E-AI/Fidel1.1-1B`

* **Class / model_type**: `FidelForCausalLM` / `fidel`.
* **Not a text transformer at all.** Its 359 tensors live entirely under a
  `policy.` prefix and the stack is bespoke (from the safetensors header, read
  by range request — the file is 5.6 GB and was never downloaded):
  * `policy.model.layers.N.mixer.mamba.*` — 88 tensors: the per-layer mixer is
    **Mamba**, not attention;
  * `policy.model.layers.N.moe.shared_fc1_gate` / `moe.w_gate` — a MoE with
    shared experts;
  * `policy.model.layer_adapters.N.base.{up,down}` and `.delta.{up,down}` — the
    per-layer rank adapters the config's `ranks` block describes (base 512,
    delta 256);
  * `policy.model.prompt_hyper_conditioner.*` (78 tensors) and
    `policy.model.prompt_cross_conditioner.*`;
  * `policy.model.contextual_prompt_v7/v8/v9.*` and `policy.chat_prompt.*` —
    four separate prompt-attention blocks;
  * `policy.model.lm_head.base.weight` + `lm_head.lora_a` — the head itself is
    base plus LoRA.
  The header's own metadata agrees with the config:
  `execution_contract: fidel_step9051_legacy_reference_fp32`.
* **Why an alias is wrong**: no engine family has mamba mixers + MoE + rank
  adapters + prompt conditioners, and `layer_adapters`,
  `prompt_hyper_conditioner` and `mixer.mamba` each have **0 hits** in this repo.
  There is no partial match to argue about.
* **Real support needs**: a scope decision first — this is a policy model, not a
  chat LM — and then the adapter/conditioner machinery.

### `zarya` — `ai-forever/Zarya-4B` (also -1.7B, -0.6B)

* **Class / model_type**: `Zarya` / `zarya`.
* **Shape**: 36 layers, H=2560, 32 heads / 8 kv, head_dim 128, intermediate 9728,
  vocab 151936, tied embeddings, rope 1e6 — llama-shaped on the surface, which
  is why the watcher's edit-distance guess proposed `zarya` → `RCPP_ARCH_ZAYA`.
* **Decisive evidence — the config is a diffusion LLM, not a Zaya MoE**: the
  official `config.json` carries `diffusion_attn_mode: causal`,
  `diffusion_loss_proportion: 0.5`, `diffusion_shuffle`, `noise_eps`,
  `noise_sorting`, `ordered_sampling`, `sample_t_override` / `sample_t_upper`,
  `grouped_noise` — a full-sequence diffusion/masking sampler. `RCPP_ARCH_ZAYA`
  is "Zaya MoE (Zyphra — MoE FFN with CCA attention)"; the Zaya configs carry
  `num_experts`/CCA keys, none of which appear here, and Zarya has no expert
  tensors to route. The two differ in the one thing a `rcpp_arch_from_string`
  mapping cannot express: the computation itself.
* **Why an alias is wrong**: mapping `zarya` onto ZAYA would route a diffusion
  sampler into the CCA-attention + MoE-FFN decode path — silent substitution,
  not a crash, exactly the `englishbase` / `vapor` failure mode above.
* **Real support needs**: a diffusion-LM sampler (or a loud refusal), not a
  one-line registry alias.

The common thread: each of these is *shaped* like a family the engine already
routes (`llama`, `gdn`, `kimi`, `lfm2`) — `fidel` only in the loosest sense, as a
Mamba/MoE hybrid — and each differs in a mechanism that changes the computation,
which is the one thing a `rcpp_arch_from_string` mapping cannot express. `vapor`
is the case worth remembering: from the config alone it looked like a one-line
alias, and only the tensors said otherwise.

**Reading a checkpoint without downloading it.** For a multi-GB
`model.safetensors`, the header is enough to settle this class of question and
costs one range request (follow redirects — `-L` — or you get the 302 body):

```sh
U=https://huggingface.co/<repo>/resolve/main/model.safetensors
H=$(curl -sSL -r 0-7 "$U" | python3 -c 'import sys,struct; print(struct.unpack("<Q", sys.stdin.buffer.read(8))[0])')
curl -sSL -r 8-$((8+H-1)) "$U" | python3 -c 'import json,sys; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print(len(d), list(d)[:20])'
```

`<repo>/raw/main/model.safetensors.index.json` answers the same question in one
request when the model is sharded.

## Unverifiable: gated configs

`WaveMatrix/Qwen3-VL-8B-Instruct-GPTQ-Int4` is counted as **unverifiable** on
every run: its `config.json` cannot be fetched anonymously, so the census
cannot classify it. `census/hf_new_models.py` sends no `Authorization` header.
Supplying a token (`HF_TOKEN` in the environment, or the standard
`~/.cache/huggingface/token`) would resolve gated repos instead of retrying
them forever.

## If a family *is* a variant

An unmapped class that is a renamed or same-shape sibling is fixed where the backend is: upstream llama.cpp's converter and `llama-arch.cpp`, our HRX fork, or ZINC. The registry picks the mapping up at the next pin bump. Verify shape equality before proposing such a mapping: layers, hidden size, heads, experts, and any added config keys. That check is exactly what moved the families above into this file.
